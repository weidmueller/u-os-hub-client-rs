Other containers are also started.
See the file link:.devcontainer/docker-compose.devcontainer.yaml[docker-compose.devcontainer.yaml] for details.

==== Regenerate flatbuffers

```sh
./tools/regenerate_fbs.sh
```

==== Generate documentation

You can generate the crate documentation via

```sh
cargo doc
```

Then you will find the documentation under `target/doc/u_os_hub_client/index.html`.

==== Run tests

You can run all tests via

```sh
cargo test
```

==== Check merge request before creating it

Before issuing a merge request, you can locally simulate all pipeline checks by running

```sh
./tools/check_merge_request.sh
```

This will build, lint, create docs and run audit and unit tests.
